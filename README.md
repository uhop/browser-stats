This utility is used to analyze Google Analytics data with "Can I use...". Download a CSV table from GA
that includes browsers and their versions and ordered in a descending order by number of users and
place it in `data/` as `raw.csv`. Then run `npm start` and see the results.

If you want to explore the results with a browser, run `npm run server` after `npm start`.
